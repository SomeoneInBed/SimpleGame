# Simple Game README

### Welcome to my first project. 

This is a simple game that I created to practice my coding skills. The game is a basic text-based adventure where you can explore different rooms, collect items, and complete quests.
It is heavily based on [Scott Lilly's tutorial](https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/for) for creating a text-based rpg in C#. 
Feel free to point out any errors and suggest improvements. Right now, I am currently trying to figure out why the potion button does not appear when expected. 
I did change the name of a few objects just to follow the flow of the logic; allowing me to understand the code better.
Also, I did not follow the tutorial to completion. I only did the first 18 lessons as I was ready to move on. I will be returning and adding to what is there because the tutorial touches 
on a few other topics I would like to explore. I am not copying and pasting, so it takes me a little longer to get through each lesson. 
Other than that, this project was fun to make and I recommend others try following the tutorial. 

Thank you,
