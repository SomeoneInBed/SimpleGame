# SimpleGame

This is a simple rpg text-based game based on [Scott Lilly's](https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/) Super Adventure tutorial using c#.
The game utilizes the windows form as a UI. You come across monsters, you fight them, then you get rewards at the end. 
<br> I am thinking of creating a deep and complicated text-based story to go along with the game, but that would take a lot of time I do not have when I need to make money. 
I am open for suggestions of what the story should be about or what it should include. 
I want a creative take on issues that we deal with everyday, maybe mental health related.
